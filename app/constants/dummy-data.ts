          'Of course! Here are 5 tips to improve your sales, based on your business data:\n\n### 1. **Prominently Feature Your Best-Sellers**\n\nYour top-performing products are the most likely to sell, so make them impossible for shoppers to miss.\n\n- **Your Top 5 Best-Sellers (Last 30 Days):**\n    1. The Archived Snowboard\n    2. The Collection Snowboard: Oxygen\n    3. The Collection Snowboard: Liquid\n    4. Bunny Bumm Snowboard Jockstrap\n    5. The Hidden Snowboard\n\n**Action Plan:**\n- Place "The Archived Snowboard" and your other top sellers on your homepage.\n- Create a "Best-Sellers" collection and feature it in your main navigation menu.\n\n### 2. **Boost Your Average Order Value (AOV)**\n\nYour current AOV is **₩588,480**. Increasing this is a quick way to drive more revenue without needing more customers.\n\n**Action Plan:**\n- **Product Bundles:** Offer a discount for purchasing related items together. For example, bundle "The Archived Snowboard" with the "Bunny Bumm Snowboard Jockstrap."\n- **"Frequently Bought Together" Section:** Add a section on your product pages to suggest complementary items.\n- **Free Shipping Threshold:** Set a free shipping minimum that is slightly above your AOV to encourage customers to add more to their cart.\n\n### 3. **Launch a Customer Loyalty Program**\n\nYou have **5 repeat customers** from the last 90 days. A loyalty program can significantly increase this number.\n\n**Action Plan:**\n- **Points System:** Reward customers with points for every purchase, which they can redeem for discounts.\n- **Exclusive Perks:** Offer members-only benefits like early access to new products or exclusive sales.\n- **Email Marketing:** Announce your new loyalty program to all past customers to re-engage them.\n\n### 4. **Run a Targeted "Buy One, Get One" (BOGO) Promotion**\n\nLeverage your best-sellers to move other inventory and attract new customers.\n\n**Action Plan:**\n- **Create a BOGO Offer:** For example, "Buy \'The Archived Snowboard\' and get a \'Bunny Bumm Snowboard Jockstrap\' for 50% off." This can increase the perceived value and drive conversions.\n\n### 5. **Engage Your Existing Customers**\n\nSince you have a solid base of customers who love your top products, focus on bringing them back.\n\n**Action Plan:**\n- **"We Miss You" Campaign:** Send an email with a special discount to customers who haven\'t purchased in a while.\n- **New Product Announcements:** Email your customer list whenever you launch new products to keep them engaged and interested in your brand.\n\nBy implementing these data-driven strategies, you can effectively boost your sales and foster greater customer loyalty. Let me know if you\'d like to dive deeper into any of these areas',

          'Of course! Here are 3 more data-driven tips to help you increase your sales:\n\n### 6. **Optimize Your Marketing for Peak Shopping Times**\n\nYour sales data shows that your customers are most active during specific hours of the day. By timing your marketing efforts to coincide with these peak times, you can capture customers when they are most likely to buy.\n\n- **Your Peak Sales Hours:**\n    - **4 AM:** ₩14,256,400 in sales\n    - **6 AM:** ₩12,469,300 in sales\n    - **8 AM:** ₩5,593,650 in sales\n\n**Action Plan:**\n- **Schedule Email & Social Media Campaigns:** Send out promotional emails and post on social media an hour or two before these peak times to ensure your brand is top-of-mind when customers are ready to shop.\n- **Run Flash Sales:** Launch limited-time offers that start at the beginning of these high-traffic periods to create a sense of urgency and drive immediate purchases. For example, a flash sale starting at 4 AM could capture that early-morning rush.\n\n### 7. **Create Targeted Product Bundles to Increase Order Value**\n\nWhile your best-sellers are driving a lot of sales, you can increase your revenue by encouraging customers to purchase more items in a single order.\n\n- **Your Top Sellers:**\n    1. The Archived Snowboard (112 units sold)\n    2. The Collection Snowboard: Oxygen (21 units sold)\n    3. The Collection Snowboard: Liquid (10 units sold)\n\n**Action Plan:**\n- **Bundle Best-Sellers with Complementary Items:** Create a "Complete Snowboarder Kit" by bundling "The Archived Snowboard" with a lower-selling but relevant item, like a snowboard bag or tuning kit. Offer this bundle at a slight discount compared to buying the items separately.\n- **"Tiered" Offers:** Encourage larger purchases with promotions like "Buy one snowboard, get 20% off any accessory" or "Spend ₩600,000 and get a free gift." This incentivizes customers to add more to their cart to unlock a reward.\n\n### 8. **Launch a "Refer-a-Friend" Program**\n\nSince you have a base of repeat customers (5 in the last 90 days), you can leverage their loyalty to acquire new customers at a lower cost than traditional advertising.\n\n**Action Plan:**\n- **Incentivize Both Parties:** Offer a discount or store credit to both the existing customer and the new customer they refer. For example, "Give your friends ₩20,000 off their first order, and you\'ll get ₩20,000 off your next purchase."\n- **Promote the Program:** Make the referral program highly visible on your website, in post-purchase emails, and on your social media channels. The easier it is for customers to find and use, the more successful it will be.\n\nBy implementing these strategies, you can further optimize your sales process, increase your average order value, and turn your existing customers into advocates for your brand.',

For example, bundle "The Archived Snowboard" with the "Bunny Bumm Snowboard Jockstrap."\n- **"Frequently Bought Together" Section:** Add a section on your product pages to suggest complementary items.\n- **Free Shipping Threshold:** Set a free shipping minimum that is slightly above your AOV to encourage customers to add more to their cart.\n\n### 3. **Launch a Customer Loyalty Program**\n\nYou have **5 repeat customers** from the last 90 days. A loyalty program can significantly increase this number.\n\n**Action Plan:**\n- **Points System:** Reward customers with points for every purchase, which they can redeem for discounts.\n- **Exclusive Perks:** Offer members-only benefits like early access to new products or exclusive sales.\n- **Email Marketing:** Announce your new loyalty program to all past customers to re-engage them.\n\n### 4. **Run a Targeted "Buy One, Get One" (BOGO) Promotion**\n\nLeverage your best-sellers to move other inventory and attract new customers.\n\n**Action Plan:**\n- **Create a BOGO Offer:** For example, "Buy \'The Archived Snowboard\' and get a \'Bunny Bumm Snowboard Jockstrap\' for 50% off." This can increase the perceived value and drive conversions.\n\n### 5. **Engage Your Existing Customers**\n\nSince you have a solid base of customers who love your top products, focus on bringing them back.\n\n**Action Plan:**\n- **"We Miss You" Campaign:** Send an email with a special discount to customers who haven\'t purchased in a while.\n- **New Product Announcements:** Email your customer list whenever you launch new products to keep them engaged and interested in your brand.\n\nBy implementing these data-driven strategies, you can effectively boost your sales and foster greater customer loyalty. Let me know if you\'d like to dive deeper into any of these areas',

Here are 5 tips to improve your sales, based on your business data:\n\n### 1. **Prominently Feature Your Best-Sellers**\n\nYour top-performing products are the most likely to sell, so make them impossible for shoppers to miss.\n\n- **Your Top 5 Best-Sellers (Last 30 Days):**\n    1. The Archived Snowboard\n    2. The Collection Snowboard: Oxygen\n    3. The Collection Snowboard: Liquid\n    4. Bunny Bumm Snowboard Jockstrap\n    5. The Hidden Snowboard\n\n**Action Plan:**\n- Place "The Archived Snowboard" and your other top sellers on your homepage.\n- Create a "Best-Sellers" collection and feature it in your main navigation menu.\n\n### 2. **Boost Your Average Order Value (AOV)**\n\nYour current AOV is **₩588,480**. Increasing this is a quick way to drive more revenue without needing more customers.\n\n**Action Plan:**\n- **Product Bundles:** Offer a discount for purchasing related items together. For example, bundle "The Archived Snowboard" with the "Bunny Bumm Snowboard Jockstrap."\n- **"Frequently Bought Together" Section:** Add a section on your product pages to suggest complementary items.\n- **Free Shipping Threshold:** Set a free shipping minimum that is slightly above your AOV to encourage customers to add more to their cart.\n\n### 3. **Launch a Customer Loyalty Program**\n\nYou have **5 repeat customers** from the last 90 days. A loyalty program can significantly increase this number.\n\n**Action Plan:**\n- **Points System:** Reward customers with points for every purchase, which they can redeem for discounts.\n- **Exclusive Perks:** Offer members-only benefits like early access to new products or exclusive sales.\n- **Email Marketing:** Announce your new loyalty program to all past customers to re-engage them.\n\n### 4. **Run a Targeted "Buy One, Get One" (BOGO) Promotion**\n\nLeverage your best-sellers to move other inventory and attract new customers.\n\n**Action Plan:**\n- **Create a BOGO Offer:** For example, "Buy \'The Archived Snowboard\' and get a \'Bunny Bumm Snowboard Jockstrap\' for 50% off." This can increase the perceived value and drive conversions.\n\n### 5. **Engage Your Existing Customers**\n\nSince you have a solid base of customers who love your top products, focus on bringing them back.\n\n**Action Plan:**\n- **"We Miss You" Campaign:** Send an email with a special discount to customers who haven\'t purchased in a while.\n- **New Product Announcements:** Email your customer list whenever you launch new products to keep them engaged and interested in your brand.\n\nBy implementing these data-driven strategies, you can effectively boost your sales and foster greater customer loyalty.

              'Of course! Here are 5 tips to improve your sales, based on your business data:\n\n### 1. **Prominently Feature Your Best-Sellers**\n\nYour top-performing products are the most likely to sell, so make them impossible for shoppers to miss.\n\n- **Your Top 5 Best-Sellers (Last 30 Days):**\n    1. The Archived Snowboard\n    2. The Collection Snowboard: Oxygen\n    3. The Collection Snowboard: Liquid\n    4. Bunny Bumm Snowboard Jockstrap\n    5. The Hidden Snowboard\n\n**Action Plan:**\n- Place "The Archived Snowboard" and your other top sellers on your homepage.\n- Create a "Best-Sellers" collection and feature it in your main navigation menu.\n\n### 2. **Boost Your Average Order Value (AOV)**\n\nYour current AOV is **₩588,480**. Increasing this is a quick way to drive more revenue without needing more customers.\n\n**Action Plan:**\n- **Product Bundles:** Offer a discount for purchasing related items together. For example, bundle "The Archived Snowboard" with the "Bunny Bumm Snowboard Jockstrap."\n- **"Frequently Bought Together" Section:** Add a section on your product pages to suggest complementary items.\n- **Free Shipping Threshold:** Set a free shipping minimum that is slightly above your AOV to encourage customers to add more to their cart.\n\n### 3. **Launch a Customer Loyalty Program**\n\nYou have **5 repeat customers** from the last 90 days. A loyalty program can significantly increase this number.\n\n**Action Plan:**\n- **Points System:** Reward customers with points for every purchase, which they can redeem for discounts.\n- **Exclusive Perks:** Offer members-only benefits like early access to new products or exclusive sales.\n- **Email Marketing:** Announce your new loyalty program to all past customers to re-engage them.\n\n### 4. **Run a Targeted "Buy One, Get One" (BOGO) Promotion**\n\nLeverage your best-sellers to move other inventory and attract new customers.\n\n**Action Plan:**\n- **Create a BOGO Offer:** For example, "Buy \'The Archived Snowboard\' and get a \'Bunny Bumm Snowboard Jockstrap\' for 50% off." This can increase the perceived value and drive conversions.\n\n### 5. **Engage Your Existing Customers**\n\nSince you have a solid base of customers who love your top products, focus on bringing them back.\n\n**Action Plan:**\n- **"We Miss You" Campaign:** Send an email with a special discount to customers who haven\'t purchased in a while.\n- **New Product Announcements:** Email your customer list whenever you launch new products to keep them engaged and interested in your brand.\n\nBy implementing these data-driven strategies, you can effectively boost your sales and foster greater customer loyalty. Let me know if you\'d like to dive deeper into any of these areas',

              'Of course! Here are 5 tips to improve your sales, based on your business data:\n\n### 1. **Prominently Feature Your Best-Sellers**\n\nYour top-performing products are the most likely to sell, so make them impossible for shoppers to miss.\n\n- **Your Top 5 Best-Sellers (Last 30 Days):**\n    1. The Archived Snowboard\n    2. The Collection Snowboard: Oxygen\n    3. The Collection Snowboard: Liquid\n    4. Bunny Bumm Snowboard Jockstrap\n    5. The Hidden Snowboard\n\n**Action Plan:**\n- Place "The Archived Snowboard" and your other top sellers on your homepage.\n- Create a "Best-Sellers" collection and feature it in your main navigation menu.\n\n### 2. **Boost Your Average Order Value (AOV)**\n\nYour current AOV is **₩588,480**. Increasing this is a quick way to drive more revenue without needing more customers.\n\n**Action Plan:**\n- **Product Bundles:** Offer a discount for purchasing related items together. For example, bundle "The Archived Snowboard" with the "Bunny Bumm Snowboard Jockstrap."\n- **"Frequently Bought Together" Section:** Add a section on your product pages to suggest complementary items.\n- **Free Shipping Threshold:** Set a free shipping minimum that is slightly above your AOV to encourage customers to add more to their cart.\n\n### 3. **Launch a Customer Loyalty Program**\n\nYou have **5 repeat customers** from the last 90 days. A loyalty program can significantly increase this number.\n\n**Action Plan:**\n- **Points System:** Reward customers with points for every purchase, which they can redeem for discounts.\n- **Exclusive Perks:** Offer members-only benefits like early access to new products or exclusive sales.\n- **Email Marketing:** Announce your new loyalty program to all past customers to re-engage them.\n\n### 4. **Run a Targeted "Buy One, Get One" (BOGO) Promotion**\n\nLeverage your best-sellers to move other inventory and attract new customers.\n\n**Action Plan:**\n- **Create a BOGO Offer:** For example, "Buy \'The Archived Snowboard\' and get a \'Bunny Bumm Snowboard Jockstrap\' for 50% off." This can increase the perceived value and drive conversions.\n\n### 5. **Engage Your Existing Customers**\n\nSince you have a solid base of customers who love your top products, focus on bringing them back.\n\n**Action Plan:**\n- **"We Miss You" Campaign:** Send an email with a special discount to customers who haven\'t purchased in a while.\n- **New Product Announcements:** Email your customer list whenever you launch new products to keep them engaged and interested in your brand.\n\nBy implementing these data-driven strategies, you can effectively boost your sales and foster greater customer loyalty. Let me know if you\'d like to dive deeper into any of these areas',

              'Of course! Here are 5 tips to improve your sales, based on your business data:\n\n### 1. **Prominently Feature Your Best-Sellers**\n\nYour top-performing products are the most likely to sell, so make them impossible for shoppers to miss.\n\n- **Your Top 5 Best-Sellers (Last 30 Days):**\n    1. The Archived Snowboard\n    2. The Collection Snowboard: Oxygen\n    3. The Collection Snowboard: Liquid\n    4. Bunny Bumm Snowboard Jockstrap\n    5. The Hidden Snowboard\n\n**Action Plan:**\n- Place "The Archived Snowboard" and your other top sellers on your homepage.\n- Create a "Best-Sellers" collection and feature it in your main navigation menu.\n\n### 2. **Boost Your Average Order Value (AOV)**\n\nYour current AOV is **₩588,480**. Increasing this is a quick way to drive more revenue without needing more customers.\n\n**Action Plan:**\n- **Product Bundles:** Offer a discount for purchasing related items together. For example, bundle "The Archived Snowboard" with the "Bunny Bumm Snowboard Jockstrap."\n- **"Frequently Bought Together" Section:** Add a section on your product pages to suggest complementary items.\n- **Free Shipping Threshold:** Set a free shipping minimum that is slightly above your AOV to encourage customers to add more to their cart.\n\n### 3. **Launch a Customer Loyalty Program**\n\nYou have **5 repeat customers** from the last 90 days. A loyalty program can significantly increase this number.\n\n**Action Plan:**\n- **Points System:** Reward customers with points for every purchase, which they can redeem for discounts.\n- **Exclusive Perks:** Offer members-only benefits like early access to new products or exclusive sales.\n- **Email Marketing:** Announce your new loyalty program to all past customers to re-engage them.\n\n### 4. **Run a Targeted "Buy One, Get One" (BOGO) Promotion**\n\nLeverage your best-sellers to move other inventory and attract new customers.\n\n**Action Plan:**\n- **Create a BOGO Offer:** For example, "Buy \'The Archived Snowboard\' and get a \'Bunny Bumm Snowboard Jockstrap\' for 50% off." This can increase the perceived value and drive conversions.\n\n### 5. **Engage Your Existing Customers**\n\nSince you have a solid base of customers who love your top products, focus on bringing them back.\n\n**Action Plan:**\n- **"We Miss You" Campaign:** Send an email with a special discount to customers who haven\'t purchased in a while.\n- **New Product Announcements:** Email your customer list whenever you launch new products to keep them engaged and interested in your brand.\n\nBy implementing these data-driven strategies, you can effectively boost your sales and foster greater customer loyalty.

              'Of course! Here are 5 tips to improve your sales, based on your business data:\n\n### 1. **Prominently Feature Your Best-Sellers**\n\nYour top-performing products are the most likely to sell, so make them impossible for shoppers to miss.\n\n- **Your Top 5 Best-Sellers (Last 30 Days):**\n    1. The Archived Snowboard\n    2. The Collection Snowboard: Oxygen\n    3. The Collection Snowboard: Liquid\n    4. Bunny Bumm Snowboard Jockstrap\n    5. The Hidden Snowboard\n\n**Action Plan:**\n- Place "The Archived Snowboard" and your other top sellers on your homepage.\n- Create a "Best-Sellers" collection and feature it in your main navigation menu.\n\n### 2. **Boost Your Average Order Value (AOV)**\n\nYour current AOV is **₩588,480**. Increasing this is a quick way to drive more revenue without needing more customers.\n\n**Action Plan:**\n- **Product Bundles:** Offer a discount for purchasing related items together. For example, bundle "The Archived Snowboard" with the "Bunny Bumm Snowboard Jockstrap."\n- **"Frequently Bought Together" Section:** Add a section on your product pages to suggest complementary items.\n- **Free Shipping Threshold:** Set a free shipping minimum that is slightly above your AOV to encourage customers to add more to their cart.\n\n### 3. **Launch a Customer Loyalty Program**\n\nYou have **5 repeat customers** from the last 90 days. A loyalty program can significantly increase this number.\n\n**Action Plan:**\n- **Points System:** Reward customers with points for every purchase, which they can redeem for discounts.\n- **Exclusive Perks:** Offer members-only benefits like early access to new products or exclusive sales.\n- **Email Marketing:** Announce your new loyalty program to all past customers to re-engage them.\n\n### 4. **Run a Targeted "Buy One, Get One" (BOGO) Promotion**\n\nLeverage your best-sellers to move other inventory and attract new customers.\n\n**Action Plan:**\n- **Create a BOGO Offer:** For example, "Buy \'The Archived Snowboard\' and get a \'Bunny Bumm Snowboard Jockstrap\' for 50% off." This can increase the perceived value and drive conversions.\n\n### 5. **Engage Your Existing Customers**\n\nSince you have a solid base of customers who love your top products, focus on bringing them back.\n\n**Action Plan:**\n- **"We Miss You" Campaign:** Send an email with a special discount to customers who haven\'t purchased in a while.\n- **New Product Announcements:** Email your customer list whenever you launch new products to keep them engaged and interested in your brand.\n\nBy implementing these data-driven strategies, you can effectively boost your sales and foster greater customer loyalty.

              'Of course! Here are 5 tips to improve your sales, based on your business data:\n\n### 1. **Prominently Feature Your Best-Sellers**\n\nYour top-performing products are the most likely to sell, so make them impossible for shoppers to miss.\n\n- **Your Top 5 Best-Sellers (Last 30 Days):**\n    1. The Archived Snowboard\n    2. The Collection Snowboard: Oxygen\n    3. The Collection Snowboard: Liquid\n    4. Bunny Bumm Snowboard Jockstrap\n    5. The Hidden Snowboard\n\n**Action Plan:**\n- Place "The Archived Snowboard" and your other top sellers on your homepage.\n- Create a "Best-Sellers" collection and feature it in your main navigation menu.\n\n### 2. **Boost Your Average Order Value (AOV)**\n\nYour current AOV is **₩588,480**. Increasing this is a quick way to drive more revenue without needing more customers.\n\n**Action Plan:**\n- **Product Bundles:** Offer a discount for purchasing related items together. For example, bundle "The Archived Snowboard" with the "Bunny Bumm Snowboard Jockstrap."\n- **"Frequently Bought Together" Section:** Add a section on your product pages to suggest complementary items.\n- **Free Shipping Threshold:** Set a free shipping minimum that is slightly above your AOV to encourage customers to add more to their cart.\n\n### 3. **Launch a Customer Loyalty Program**\n\nYou have **5 repeat customers** from the last 90 days. A loyalty program can significantly increase this number.\n\n**Action Plan:**\n- **Points System:** Reward customers with points for every purchase, which they can redeem for discounts.\n- **Exclusive Perks:** Offer members-only benefits like early access to new products or exclusive sales.\n- **Email Marketing:** Announce your new loyalty program to all past customers to re-engage them.\n\n### 4. **Run a Targeted "Buy One, Get One" (BOGO) Promotion**\n\nLeverage your best-sellers to move other inventory and attract new customers.\n\n**Action Plan:**\n- **Create a BOGO Offer:** For example, "Buy \'The Archived Snowboard\' and get a \'Bunny Bumm Snowboard Jockstrap\' for 50% off." This can increase the perceived value and drive conversions.\n\n### 5. **Engage Your Existing Customers**\n\nSince you have a solid base of customers who love your top products, focus on bringing them back.\n\n**Action Plan:**\n- **"We Miss You" Campaign:** Send an email with a special discount to customers who haven\'t purchased in a while.\n- **New Product Announcements:** Email your customer list whenever you launch new products to keep them engaged and interested in your brand.\n\nBy implementing these data-driven strategies, you can effectively boost your sales and foster greater customer loyalty.

                  'Of course! Here are 3 more data-driven tips to help you increase your sales:\n\n### 6. **Optimize Your Marketing for Peak Shopping Times**\n\nYour sales data shows that your customers are most active during specific hours of the day. By timing your marketing efforts to coincide with these peak times, you can capture customers when they are most likely to buy.\n\n- **Your Peak Sales Hours:**\n    - **4 AM:** ₩14,256,400 in sales\n    - **6 AM:** ₩12,469,300 in sales\n    - **8 AM:** ₩5,593,650 in sales\n\n**Action Plan:**\n- **Schedule Email & Social Media Campaigns:** Send out promotional emails and post on social media an hour or two before these peak times to ensure your brand is top-of-mind when customers are ready to shop.\n- **Run Flash Sales:** Launch limited-time offers that start at the beginning of these high-traffic periods to create a sense of urgency and drive immediate purchases. For example, a flash sale starting at 4 AM could capture that early-morning rush.\n\n### 7. **Create Targeted Product Bundles to Increase Order Value**\n\nWhile your best-sellers are driving a lot of sales, you can increase your revenue by encouraging customers to purchase more items in a single order.\n\n- **Your Top Sellers:**\n    1. The Archived Snowboard (112 units sold)\n    2. The Collection Snowboard: Oxygen (21 units sold)\n    3. The Collection Snowboard: Liquid (10 units sold)\n\n**Action Plan:**\n- **Bundle Best-Sellers with Complementary Items:** Create a "Complete Snowboarder Kit" by bundling "The Archived Snowboard" with a lower-selling but relevant item, like a snowboard bag or tuning kit. Offer this bundle at a slight discount compared to buying the items separately.\n- **"Tiered" Offers:** Encourage larger purchases with promotions like "Buy one snowboard, get 20% off any accessory" or "Spend ₩600,000 and get a free gift." This incentivizes customers to add more to their cart to unlock a reward.\n\n### 8. **Launch a "Refer-a-Friend" Program**\n\nSince you have a base of repeat customers (5 in the last 90 days), you can leverage their loyalty to acquire new customers at a lower cost than traditional advertising.\n\n**Action Plan:**\n- **Incentivize Both Parties:** Offer a discount or store credit to both the existing customer and the new customer they refer. For example, "Give your friends ₩20,000 off their first order, and you\'ll get ₩20,000 off your next purchase."\n- **Promote the Program:** Make the referral program highly visible on your website, in post-purchase emails, and on your social media channels. The easier it is for customers to find and use, the more successful it will be.\n\nBy implementing these strategies, you can further optimize your sales process, increase your average order value, and turn your existing customers into advocates for your brand.',

              'Of course! Here are 5 tips to improve your sales, based on your business data:\n\n### 1. **Prominently Feature Your Best-Sellers**\n\nYour top-performing products are the most likely to sell, so make them impossible for shoppers to miss.\n\n- **Your Top 5 Best-Sellers (Last 30 Days):**\n    1. The Archived Snowboard\n    2. The Collection Snowboard: Oxygen\n    3. The Collection Snowboard: Liquid\n    4. Bunny Bumm Snowboard Jockstrap\n    5. The Hidden Snowboard\n\n**Action Plan:**\n- Place "The Archived Snowboard" and your other top sellers on your homepage.\n- Create a "Best-Sellers" collection and feature it in your main navigation menu.\n\n### 2. **Boost Your Average Order Value (AOV)**\n\nYour current AOV is **₩588,480**. Increasing this is a quick way to drive more revenue without needing more customers.\n\n**Action Plan:**\n- **Product Bundles:** Offer a discount for purchasing related items together. For example, bundle "The Archived Snowboard" with the "Bunny Bumm Snowboard Jockstrap."\n- **"Frequently Bought Together" Section:** Add a section on your product pages to suggest complementary items.\n- **Free Shipping Threshold:** Set a free shipping minimum that is slightly above your AOV to encourage customers to add more to their cart.\n\n### 3. **Launch a Customer Loyalty Program**\n\nYou have **5 repeat customers** from the last 90 days. A loyalty program can significantly increase this number.\n\n**Action Plan:**\n- **Points System:** Reward customers with points for every purchase, which they can redeem for discounts.\n- **Exclusive Perks:** Offer members-only benefits like early access to new products or exclusive sales.\n- **Email Marketing:** Announce your new loyalty program to all past customers to re-engage them.\n\n### 4. **Run a Targeted "Buy One, Get One" (BOGO) Promotion**\n\nLeverage your best-sellers to move other inventory and attract new customers.\n\n**Action Plan:**\n- **Create a BOGO Offer:** For example, "Buy \'The Archived Snowboard\' and get a \'Bunny Bumm Snowboard Jockstrap\' for 50% off." This can increase the perceived value and drive conversions.\n\n### 5. **Engage Your Existing Customers**\n\nSince you have a solid base of customers who love your top products, focus on bringing them back.\n\n**Action Plan:**\n- **"We Miss You" Campaign:** Send an email with a special discount to customers who haven\'t purchased in a while.\n- **New Product Announcements:** Email your customer list whenever you launch new products to keep them engaged and interested in your brand.\n\nBy implementing these data-driven strategies, you can effectively boost your sales and foster greater customer loyalty.

              'Of course! Here are 3 more data-driven tips to help you increase your sales:\n\n### 6. **Optimize Your Marketing for Peak Shopping Times**\n\nYour sales data shows that your customers are most active during specific hours of the day. By timing your marketing efforts to coincide with these peak times, you can capture customers when they are most likely to buy.\n\n- **Your Peak Sales Hours:**\n    - **4 AM:** ₩14,256,400 in sales\n    - **6 AM:** ₩12,469,300 in sales\n    - **8 AM:** ₩5,593,650 in sales\n\n**Action Plan:**\n- **Schedule Email & Social Media Campaigns:** Send out promotional emails and post on social media an hour or two before these peak times to ensure your brand is top-of-mind when customers are ready to shop.\n- **Run Flash Sales:** Launch limited-time offers that start at the beginning of these high-traffic periods to create a sense of urgency and drive immediate purchases. For example, a flash sale starting at 4 AM could capture that early-morning rush.\n\n### 7. **Create Targeted Product Bundles to Increase Order Value**\n\nWhile your best-sellers are driving a lot of sales, you can increase your revenue by encouraging customers to purchase more items in a single order.\n\n- **Your Top Sellers:**\n    1. The Archived Snowboard (112 units sold)\n    2. The Collection Snowboard: Oxygen (21 units sold)\n    3. The Collection Snowboard: Liquid (10 units sold)\n\n**Action Plan:**\n- **Bundle Best-Sellers with Complementary Items:** Create a "Complete Snowboarder Kit" by bundling "The Archived Snowboard" with a lower-selling but relevant item, like a snowboard bag or tuning kit. Offer this bundle at a slight discount compared to buying the items separately.\n- **"Tiered" Offers:** Encourage larger purchases with promotions like "Buy one snowboard, get 20% off any accessory" or "Spend ₩600,000 and get a free gift." This incentivizes customers to add more to their cart to unlock a reward.\n\n### 8. **Launch a "Refer-a-Friend" Program**\n\nSince you have a base of repeat customers (5 in the last 90 days), you can leverage their loyalty to acquire new customers at a lower cost than traditional advertising.\n\n**Action Plan:**\n- **Incentivize Both Parties:** Offer a discount or store credit to both the existing customer and the new customer they refer. For example, "Give your friends ₩20,000 off their first order, and you\'ll get ₩20,000 off your next purchase."\n- **Promote the Program:** Make the referral program highly visible on your website, in post-purchase emails, and on your social media channels. The easier it is for customers to find and use, the more successful it will be.\n\nBy implementing these strategies, you can further optimize your sales process, increase your average order value, and turn your existing customers into advocates for your brand.',

              'Of course! Here are 5 tips to improve your sales, based on your business data:\n\n### 1. **Prominently Feature Your Best-Sellers**\n\nYour top-performing products are the most likely to sell, so make them impossible for shoppers to miss.\n\n- **Your Top 5 Best-Sellers (Last 30 Days):**\n    1. The Archived Snowboard\n    2. The Collection Snowboard: Oxygen\n    3. The Collection Snowboard: Liquid\n    4. Bunny Bumm Snowboard Jockstrap\n    5. The Hidden Snowboard\n\n**Action Plan:**\n- Place "The Archived Snowboard" and your other top sellers on your homepage.\n- Create a "Best-Sellers" collection and feature it in your main navigation menu.\n\n### 2. **Boost Your Average Order Value (AOV)**\n\nYour current AOV is **₩588,480**. Increasing this is a quick way to drive more revenue without needing more customers.\n\n**Action Plan:**\n- **Product Bundles:** Offer a discount for purchasing related items together. For example, bundle "The Archived Snowboard" with the "Bunny Bumm Snowboard Jockstrap."\n- **"Frequently Bought Together" Section:** Add a section on your product pages to suggest complementary items.\n- **Free Shipping Threshold:** Set a free shipping minimum that is slightly above your AOV to encourage customers to add more to their cart.\n\n### 3. **Launch a Customer Loyalty Program**\n\nYou have **5 repeat customers** from the last 90 days. A loyalty program can significantly increase this number.\n\n**Action Plan:**\n- **Points System:** Reward customers with points for every purchase, which they can redeem for discounts.\n- **Exclusive Perks:** Offer members-only benefits like early access to new products or exclusive sales.\n- **Email Marketing:** Announce your new loyalty program to all past customers to re-engage them.\n\n### 4. **Run a Targeted "Buy One, Get One" (BOGO) Promotion**\n\nLeverage your best-sellers to move other inventory and attract new customers.\n\n**Action Plan:**\n- **Create a BOGO Offer:** For example, "Buy \'The Archived Snowboard\' and get a \'Bunny Bumm Snowboard Jockstrap\' for 50% off." This can increase the perceived value and drive conversions.\n\n### 5. **Engage Your Existing Customers**\n\nSince you have a solid base of customers who love your top products, focus on bringing them back.\n\n**Action Plan:**\n- **"We Miss You" Campaign:** Send an email with a special discount to customers who haven\'t purchased in a while.\n- **New Product Announcements:** Email your customer list whenever you launch new products to keep them engaged and interested in your brand.\n\nBy implementing these data-driven strategies, you can effectively boost your sales and foster greater customer loyalty. Let me know if you\'d like to dive deeper into any of these areas',

              'Of course! Here are 3 more data-driven tips to help you increase your sales:\n\n### 6. **Optimize Your Marketing for Peak Shopping Times**\n\nYour sales data shows that your customers are most active during specific hours of the day. By timing your marketing efforts to coincide with these peak times, you can capture customers when they are most likely to buy.\n\n- **Your Peak Sales Hours:**\n    - **4 AM:** ₩14,256,400 in sales\n    - **6 AM:** ₩12,469,300 in sales\n    - **8 AM:** ₩5,593,650 in sales\n\n**Action Plan:**\n- **Schedule Email & Social Media Campaigns:** Send out promotional emails and post on social media an hour or two before these peak times to ensure your brand is top-of-mind when customers are ready to shop.\n- **Run Flash Sales:** Launch limited-time offers that start at the beginning of these high-traffic periods to create a sense of urgency and drive immediate purchases. For example, a flash sale starting at 4 AM could capture that early-morning rush.\n\n### 7. **Create Targeted Product Bundles to Increase Order Value**\n\nWhile your best-sellers are driving a lot of sales, you can increase your revenue by encouraging customers to purchase more items in a single order.\n\n- **Your Top Sellers:**\n    1. The Archived Snowboard (112 units sold)\n    2. The Collection Snowboard: Oxygen (21 units sold)\n    3. The Collection Snowboard: Liquid (10 units sold)\n\n**Action Plan:**\n- **Bundle Best-Sellers with Complementary Items:** Create a "Complete Snowboarder Kit" by bundling "The Archived Snowboard" with a lower-selling but relevant item, like a snowboard bag or tuning kit. Offer this bundle at a slight discount compared to buying the items separately.\n- **"Tiered" Offers:** Encourage larger purchases with promotions like "Buy one snowboard, get 20% off any accessory" or "Spend ₩600,000 and get a free gift." This incentivizes customers to add more to their cart to unlock a reward.\n\n### 8. **Launch a "Refer-a-Friend" Program**\n\nSince you have a base of repeat customers (5 in the last 90 days), you can leverage their loyalty to acquire new customers at a lower cost than traditional advertising.\n\n**Action Plan:**\n- **Incentivize Both Parties:** Offer a discount or store credit to both the existing customer and the new customer they refer. For example, "Give your friends ₩20,000 off their first order, and you\'ll get ₩20,000 off your next purchase."\n- **Promote the Program:** Make the referral program highly visible on your website, in post-purchase emails, and on your social media channels. The easier it is for customers to find and use, the more successful it will be.\n\nBy implementing these strategies, you can further optimize your sales process, increase your average order value, and turn your existing customers into advocates for your brand.',

                      'Of course! Here are 5 tips to improve your sales, based on your business data:\n\n### 1. **Prominently Feature Your Best-Sellers**\n\nYour top-performing products are the most likely to sell, so make them impossible for shoppers to miss.\n\n- **Your Top 5 Best-Sellers (Last 30 Days):**\n    1. The Archived Snowboard\n    2. The Collection Snowboard: Oxygen\n    3. The Collection Snowboard: Liquid\n    4. Bunny Bumm Snowboard Jockstrap\n    5. The Hidden Snowboard\n\n**Action Plan:**\n- Place "The Archived Snowboard" and your other top sellers on your homepage.\n- Create a "Best-Sellers" collection and feature it in your main navigation menu.\n\n### 2. **Boost Your Average Order Value (AOV)**\n\nYour current AOV is **₩588,480**. Increasing this is a quick way to drive more revenue without needing more customers.\n\n**Action Plan:**\n- **Product Bundles:** Offer a discount for purchasing related items together. For example, bundle "The Archived Snowboard" with the "Bunny Bumm Snowboard Jockstrap."\n- **"Frequently Bought Together" Section:** Add a section on your product pages to suggest complementary items.\n- **Free Shipping Threshold:** Set a free shipping minimum that is slightly above your AOV to encourage customers to add more to their cart.\n\n### 3. **Launch a Customer Loyalty Program**\n\nYou have **5 repeat customers** from the last 90 days. A loyalty program can significantly increase this number.\n\n**Action Plan:**\n- **Points System:** Reward customers with points for every purchase, which they can redeem for discounts.\n- **Exclusive Perks:** Offer members-only benefits like early access to new products or exclusive sales.\n- **Email Marketing:** Announce your new loyalty program to all past customers to re-engage them.\n\n### 4. **Run a Targeted "Buy One, Get One" (BOGO) Promotion**\n\nLeverage your best-sellers to move other inventory and attract new customers.\n\n**Action Plan:**\n- **Create a BOGO Offer:** For example, "Buy \'The Archived Snowboard\' and get a \'Bunny Bumm Snowboard Jockstrap\' for 50% off." This can increase the perceived value and drive conversions.\n\n### 5. **Engage Your Existing Customers**\n\nSince you have a solid base of customers who love your top products, focus on bringing them back.\n\n**Action Plan:**\n- **"We Miss You" Campaign:** Send an email with a special discount to customers who haven\'t purchased in a while.\n- **New Product Announcements:** Email your customer list whenever you launch new products to keep them engaged and interested in your brand.\n\nBy implementing these data-driven strategies, you can effectively boost your sales and foster greater customer loyalty. Let me know if you\'d like to dive deeper into any of these areas',

                  'Of course! Here are 5 tips to improve your sales, based on your business data:\n\n### 1. **Prominently Feature Your Best-Sellers**\n\nYour top-performing products are the most likely to sell, so make them impossible for shoppers to miss.\n\n- **Your Top 5 Best-Sellers (Last 30 Days):**\n    1. The Archived Snowboard\n    2. The Collection Snowboard: Oxygen\n    3. The Collection Snowboard: Liquid\n    4. Bunny Bumm Snowboard Jockstrap\n    5. The Hidden Snowboard\n\n**Action Plan:**\n- Place "The Archived Snowboard" and your other top sellers on your homepage.\n- Create a "Best-Sellers" collection and feature it in your main navigation menu.\n\n### 2. **Boost Your Average Order Value (AOV)**\n\nYour current AOV is **₩588,480**. Increasing this is a quick way to drive more revenue without needing more customers.\n\n**Action Plan:**\n- **Product Bundles:** Offer a discount for purchasing related items together. For example, bundle "The Archived Snowboard" with the "Bunny Bumm Snowboard Jockstrap."\n- **"Frequently Bought Together" Section:** Add a section on your product pages to suggest complementary items.\n- **Free Shipping Threshold:** Set a free shipping minimum that is slightly above your AOV to encourage customers to add more to their cart.\n\n### 3. **Launch a Customer Loyalty Program**\n\nYou have **5 repeat customers** from the last 90 days. A loyalty program can significantly increase this number.\n\n**Action Plan:**\n- **Points System:** Reward customers with points for every purchase, which they can redeem for discounts.\n- **Exclusive Perks:** Offer members-only benefits like early access to new products or exclusive sales.\n- **Email Marketing:** Announce your new loyalty program to all past customers to re-engage them.\n\n### 4. **Run a Targeted "Buy One, Get One" (BOGO) Promotion**\n\nLeverage your best-sellers to move other inventory and attract new customers.\n\n**Action Plan:**\n- **Create a BOGO Offer:** For example, "Buy \'The Archived Snowboard\' and get a \'Bunny Bumm Snowboard Jockstrap\' for 50% off." This can increase the perceived value and drive conversions.\n\n### 5. **Engage Your Existing Customers**\n\nSince you have a solid base of customers who love your top products, focus on bringing them back.\n\n**Action Plan:**\n- **"We Miss You" Campaign:** Send an email with a special discount to customers who haven\'t purchased in a while.\n- **New Product Announcements:** Email your customer list whenever you launch new products to keep them engaged and interested in your brand.\n\nBy implementing these data-driven strategies, you can effectively boost your sales and foster greater customer loyalty. Let me know if you\'d like to dive deeper into any of these areas',

                  'Of course! Here are 5 tips to improve your sales, based on your business data:\n\n### 1. **Prominently Feature Your Best-Sellers**\n\nYour top-performing products are the most likely to sell, so make them impossible for shoppers to miss.\n\n- **Your Top 5 Best-Sellers (Last 30 Days):**\n    1. The Archived Snowboard\n    2. The Collection Snowboard: Oxygen\n    3. The Collection Snowboard: Liquid\n    4. Bunny Bumm Snowboard Jockstrap\n    5. The Hidden Snowboard\n\n**Action Plan:**\n- Place "The Archived Snowboard" and your other top sellers on your homepage.\n- Create a "Best-Sellers" collection and feature it in your main navigation menu.\n\n### 2. **Boost Your Average Order Value (AOV)**\n\nYour current AOV is **₩588,480**. Increasing this is a quick way to drive more revenue without needing more customers.\n\n**Action Plan:**\n- **Product Bundles:** Offer a discount for purchasing related items together. For example, bundle "The Archived Snowboard" with the "Bunny Bumm Snowboard Jockstrap."\n- **"Frequently Bought Together" Section:** Add a section on your product pages to suggest complementary items.\n- **Free Shipping Threshold:** Set a free shipping minimum that is slightly above your AOV to encourage customers to add more to their cart.\n\n### 3. **Launch a Customer Loyalty Program**\n\nYou have **5 repeat customers** from the last 90 days. A loyalty program can significantly increase this number.\n\n**Action Plan:**\n- **Points System:** Reward customers with points for every purchase, which they can redeem for discounts.\n- **Exclusive Perks:** Offer members-only benefits like early access to new products or exclusive sales.\n- **Email Marketing:** Announce your new loyalty program to all past customers to re-engage them.\n\n### 4. **Run a Targeted "Buy One, Get One" (BOGO) Promotion**\n\nLeverage your best-sellers to move other inventory and attract new customers.\n\n**Action Plan:**\n- **Create a BOGO Offer:** For example, "Buy \'The Archived Snowboard\' and get a \'Bunny Bumm Snowboard Jockstrap\' for 50% off." This can increase the perceived value and drive conversions.\n\n### 5. **Engage Your Existing Customers**\n\nSince you have a solid base of customers who love your top products, focus on bringing them back.\n\n**Action Plan:**\n- **"We Miss You" Campaign:** Send an email with a special discount to customers who haven\'t purchased in a while.\n- **New Product Announcements:** Email your customer list whenever you launch new products to keep them engaged and interested in your brand.\n\nBy implementing these data-driven strategies, you can effectively boost your sales and foster greater customer loyalty. Let me know if you\'d like to dive deeper into any of these areas',

                  'Of course! Here are 5 tips to improve your sales, based on your business data:\n\n### 1. **Prominently Feature Your Best-Sellers**\n\nYour top-performing products are the most likely to sell, so make them impossible for shoppers to miss.\n\n- **Your Top 5 Best-Sellers (Last 30 Days):**\n    1. The Archived Snowboard\n    2. The Collection Snowboard: Oxygen\n    3. The Collection Snowboard: Liquid\n    4. Bunny Bumm Snowboard Jockstrap\n    5. The Hidden Snowboard\n\n**Action Plan:**\n- Place "The Archived Snowboard" and your other top sellers on your homepage.\n- Create a "Best-Sellers" collection and feature it in your main navigation menu.\n\n### 2. **Boost Your Average Order Value (AOV)**\n\nYour current AOV is **₩588,480**. Increasing this is a quick way to drive more revenue without needing more customers.\n\n**Action Plan:**\n- **Product Bundles:** Offer a discount for purchasing related items together. For example, bundle "The Archived Snowboard" with the "Bunny Bumm Snowboard Jockstrap."\n- **"Frequently Bought Together" Section:** Add a section on your product pages to suggest complementary items.\n- **Free Shipping Threshold:** Set a free shipping minimum that is slightly above your AOV to encourage customers to add more to their cart.\n\n### 3. **Launch a Customer Loyalty Program**\n\nYou have **5 repeat customers** from the last 90 days. A loyalty program can significantly increase this number.\n\n**Action Plan:**\n- **Points System:** Reward customers with points for every purchase, which they can redeem for discounts.\n- **Exclusive Perks:** Offer members-only benefits like early access to new products or exclusive sales.\n- **Email Marketing:** Announce your new loyalty program to all past customers to re-engage them.\n\n### 4. **Run a Targeted "Buy One, Get One" (BOGO) Promotion**\n\nLeverage your best-sellers to move other inventory and attract new customers.\n\n**Action Plan:**\n- **Create a BOGO Offer:** For example, "Buy \'The Archived Snowboard\' and get a \'Bunny Bumm Snowboard Jockstrap\' for 50% off." This can increase the perceived value and drive conversions.\n\n### 5. **Engage Your Existing Customers**\n\nSince you have a solid base of customers who love your top products, focus on bringing them back.\n\n**Action Plan:**\n- **"We Miss You" Campaign:** Send an email with a special discount to customers who haven\'t purchased in a while.\n- **New Product Announcements:** Email your customer list whenever you launch new products to keep them engaged and interested in your brand.\n\nBy implementing these data-driven strategies, you can effectively boost your sales and foster greater customer loyalty.

                  'Of course! Here are 5 tips to improve your sales, based on your business data:\n\n### 1. **Prominently Feature Your Best-Sellers**\n\nYour top-performing products are the most likely to sell, so make them impossible for shoppers to miss.\n\n- **Your Top 5 Best-Sellers (Last 30 Days):**\n    1. The Archived Snowboard\n    2. The Collection Snowboard: Oxygen\n    3. The Collection Snowboard: Liquid\n    4. Bunny Bumm Snowboard Jockstrap\n    5. The Hidden Snowboard\n\n**Action Plan:**\n- Place "The Archived Snowboard" and your other top sellers on your homepage.\n- Create a "Best-Sellers" collection and feature it in your main navigation menu.\n\n### 2. **Boost Your Average Order Value (AOV)**\n\nYour current AOV is **₩588,480**. Increasing this is a quick way to drive more revenue without needing more customers.\n\n**Action Plan:**\n- **Product Bundles:** Offer a discount for purchasing related items together. For example, bundle "The Archived Snowboard" with the "Bunny Bumm Snowboard Jockstrap."\n- **"Frequently Bought Together" Section:** Add a section on your product pages to suggest complementary items.\n- **Free Shipping Threshold:** Set a free shipping minimum that is slightly above your AOV to encourage customers to add more to their cart.\n\n### 3. **Launch a Customer Loyalty Program**\n\nYou have **5 repeat customers** from the last 90 days. A loyalty program can significantly increase this number.\n\n**Action Plan:**\n- **Points System:** Reward customers with points for every purchase, which they can redeem for discounts.\n- **Exclusive Perks:** Offer members-only benefits like early access to new products or exclusive sales.\n- **Email Marketing:** Announce your new loyalty program to all past customers to re-engage them.\n\n### 4. **Run a Targeted "Buy One, Get One" (BOGO) Promotion**\n\nLeverage your best-sellers to move other inventory and attract new customers.\n\n**Action Plan:**\n- **Create a BOGO Offer:** For example, "Buy \'The Archived Snowboard\' and get a \'Bunny Bumm Snowboard Jockstrap\' for 50% off." This can increase the perceived value and drive conversions.\n\n### 5. **Engage Your Existing Customers**\n\nSince you have a solid base of customers who love your top products, focus on bringing them back.\n\n**Action Plan:**\n- **"We Miss You" Campaign:** Send an email with a special discount to customers who haven\'t purchased in a while.\n- **New Product Announcements:** Email your customer list whenever you launch new products to keep them engaged and interested in your brand.\n\nBy implementing these data-driven strategies, you can effectively boost your sales and foster greater customer loyalty.

                  'Of course! Here are 5 tips to improve your sales, based on your business data:\n\n### 1. **Prominently Feature Your Best-Sellers**\n\nYour top-performing products are the most likely to sell, so make them impossible for shoppers to miss.\n\n- **Your Top 5 Best-Sellers (Last 30 Days):**\n    1. The Archived Snowboard\n    2. The Collection Snowboard: Oxygen\n    3. The Collection Snowboard: Liquid\n    4. Bunny Bumm Snowboard Jockstrap\n    5. The Hidden Snowboard\n\n**Action Plan:**\n- Place "The Archived Snowboard" and your other top sellers on your homepage.\n- Create a "Best-Sellers" collection and feature it in your main navigation menu.\n\n### 2. **Boost Your Average Order Value (AOV)**\n\nYour current AOV is **₩588,480**. Increasing this is a quick way to drive more revenue without needing more customers.\n\n**Action Plan:**\n- **Product Bundles:** Offer a discount for purchasing related items together. For example, bundle "The Archived Snowboard" with the "Bunny Bumm Snowboard Jockstrap."\n- **"Frequently Bought Together" Section:** Add a section on your product pages to suggest complementary items.\n- **Free Shipping Threshold:** Set a free shipping minimum that is slightly above your AOV to encourage customers to add more to their cart.\n\n### 3. **Launch a Customer Loyalty Program**\n\nYou have **5 repeat customers** from the last 90 days. A loyalty program can significantly increase this number.\n\n**Action Plan:**\n- **Points System:** Reward customers with points for every purchase, which they can redeem for discounts.\n- **Exclusive Perks:** Offer members-only benefits like early access to new products or exclusive sales.\n- **Email Marketing:** Announce your new loyalty program to all past customers to re-engage them.\n\n### 4. **Run a Targeted "Buy One, Get One" (BOGO) Promotion**\n\nLeverage your best-sellers to move other inventory and attract new customers.\n\n**Action Plan:**\n- **Create a BOGO Offer:** For example, "Buy \'The Archived Snowboard\' and get a \'Bunny Bumm Snowboard Jockstrap\' for 50% off." This can increase the perceived value and drive conversions.\n\n### 5. **Engage Your Existing Customers**\n\nSince you have a solid base of customers who love your top products, focus on bringing them back.\n\n**Action Plan:**\n- **"We Miss You" Campaign:** Send an email with a special discount to customers who haven\'t purchased in a while.\n- **New Product Announcements:** Email your customer list whenever you launch new products to keep them engaged and interested in your brand.\n\nBy implementing these data-driven strategies, you can effectively boost your sales and foster greater customer loyalty.

                  'Of course! Here are 5 tips to improve your sales, based on your business data:\n\n### 1. **Prominently Feature Your Best-Sellers**\n\nYour top-performing products are the most likely to sell, so make them impossible for shoppers to miss.\n\n- **Your Top 5 Best-Sellers (Last 30 Days):**\n    1. The Archived Snowboard\n    2. The Collection Snowboard: Oxygen\n    3. The Collection Snowboard: Liquid\n    4. Bunny Bumm Snowboard Jockstrap\n    5. The Hidden Snowboard\n\n**Action Plan:**\n- Place "The Archived Snowboard" and your other top sellers on your homepage.\n- Create a "Best-Sellers" collection and feature it in your main navigation menu.\n\n### 2. **Boost Your Average Order Value (AOV)**\n\nYour current AOV is **₩588,480**. Increasing this is a quick way to drive more revenue without needing more customers.\n\n**Action Plan:**\n- **Product Bundles:** Offer a discount for purchasing related items together. For example, bundle "The Archived Snowboard" with the "Bunny Bumm Snowboard Jockstrap."\n- **"Frequently Bought Together" Section:** Add a section on your product pages to suggest complementary items.\n- **Free Shipping Threshold:** Set a free shipping minimum that is slightly above your AOV to encourage customers to add more to their cart.\n\n### 3. **Launch a Customer Loyalty Program**\n\nYou have **5 repeat customers** from the last 90 days. A loyalty program can significantly increase this number.\n\n**Action Plan:**\n- **Points System:** Reward customers with points for every purchase, which they can redeem for discounts.\n- **Exclusive Perks:** Offer members-only benefits like early access to new products or exclusive sales.\n- **Email Marketing:** Announce your new loyalty program to all past customers to re-engage them.\n\n### 4. **Run a Targeted "Buy One, Get One" (BOGO) Promotion**\n\nLeverage your best-sellers to move other inventory and attract new customers.\n\n**Action Plan:**\n- **Create a BOGO Offer:** For example, "Buy \'The Archived Snowboard\' and get a \'Bunny Bumm Snowboard Jockstrap\' for 50% off." This can increase the perceived value and drive conversions.\n\n### 5. **Engage Your Existing Customers**\n\nSince you have a solid base of customers who love your top products, focus on bringing them back.\n\n**Action Plan:**\n- **"We Miss You" Campaign:** Send an email with a special discount to customers who haven\'t purchased in a while.\n- **New Product Announcements:** Email your customer list whenever you launch new products to keep them engaged and interested in your brand.\n\nBy implementing these data-driven strategies, you can effectively boost your sales and foster greater customer loyalty.

Here are 3 more data-driven tips to help you increase your sales:\n\n### 6. **Optimize Your Marketing for Peak Shopping Times**\n\nYour sales data shows that your customers are most active during specific hours of the day. By timing your marketing efforts to coincide with these peak times, you can capture customers when they are most likely to buy.\n\n- **Your Peak Sales Hours:**\n    - **4 AM:** ₩14,256,400 in sales\n    - **6 AM:** ₩12,469,300 in sales\n    - **8 AM:** ₩5,593,650 in sales\n\n**Action Plan:**\n- **Schedule Email & Social Media Campaigns:** Send out promotional emails and post on social media an hour or two before these peak times to ensure your brand is top-of-mind when customers are ready to shop.\n- **Run Flash Sales:** Launch limited-time offers that start at the beginning of these high-traffic periods to create a sense of urgency and drive immediate purchases. For example, a flash sale starting at 4 AM could capture that early-morning rush.\n\n### 7. **Create Targeted Product Bundles to Increase Order Value**\n\nWhile your best-sellers are driving a lot of sales, you can increase your revenue by encouraging customers to purchase more items in a single order.\n\n- **Your Top Sellers:**\n    1. The Archived Snowboard (112 units sold)\n    2. The Collection Snowboard: Oxygen (21 units sold)\n    3. The Collection Snowboard: Liquid (10 units sold)\n\n**Action Plan:**\n- **Bundle Best-Sellers with Complementary Items:** Create a "Complete Snowboarder Kit" by bundling "The Archived Snowboard" with a lower-selling but relevant item, like a snowboard bag or tuning kit. Offer this bundle at a slight discount compared to buying the items separately.\n- **"Tiered" Offers:** Encourage larger purchases with promotions like "Buy one snowboard, get 20% off any accessory" or "Spend ₩600,000 and get a free gift." This incentivizes customers to add more to their cart to unlock a reward.\n\n### 8. **Launch a "Refer-a-Friend" Program**\n\nSince you have a base of repeat customers (5 in the last 90 days), you can leverage their loyalty to acquire new customers at a lower cost than traditional advertising.\n\n**Action Plan:**\n- **Incentivize Both Parties:** Offer a discount or store credit to both the existing customer and the new customer they refer. For example, "Give your friends ₩20,000 off their first order, and you\'ll get ₩20,000 off your next purchase."\n- **Promote the Program:** Make the referral program highly visible on your website, in post-purchase emails, and on your social media channels. The easier it is for customers to find and use, the more successful it will be.\n\nBy implementing these strategies, you can further optimize your sales process, increase your average order value, and turn your existing customers into advocates for your brand.',

                  'Of course! Here are 5 tips to improve your sales, based on your business data:\n\n### 1. **Prominently Feature Your Best-Sellers**\n\nYour top-performing products are the most likely to sell, so make them impossible for shoppers to miss.\n\n- **Your Top 5 Best-Sellers (Last 30 Days):**\n    1. The Archived Snowboard\n    2. The Collection Snowboard: Oxygen\n    3. The Collection Snowboard: Liquid\n    4. Bunny Bumm Snowboard Jockstrap\n    5. The Hidden Snowboard\n\n**Action Plan:**\n- Place "The Archived Snowboard" and your other top sellers on your homepage.\n- Create a "Best-Sellers" collection and feature it in your main navigation menu.\n\n### 2. **Boost Your Average Order Value (AOV)**\n\nYour current AOV is **₩588,480**. Increasing this is a quick way to drive more revenue without needing more customers.\n\n**Action Plan:**\n- **Product Bundles:** Offer a discount for purchasing related items together. For example, bundle "The Archived Snowboard" with the "Bunny Bumm Snowboard Jockstrap."\n- **"Frequently Bought Together" Section:** Add a section on your product pages to suggest complementary items.\n- **Free Shipping Threshold:** Set a free shipping minimum that is slightly above your AOV to encourage customers to add more to their cart.\n\n### 3. **Launch a Customer Loyalty Program**\n\nYou have **5 repeat customers** from the last 90 days. A loyalty program can significantly increase this number.\n\n**Action Plan:**\n- **Points System:** Reward customers with points for every purchase, which they can redeem for discounts.\n- **Exclusive Perks:** Offer members-only benefits like early access to new products or exclusive sales.\n- **Email Marketing:** Announce your new loyalty program to all past customers to re-engage them.\n\n### 4. **Run a Targeted "Buy One, Get One" (BOGO) Promotion**\n\nLeverage your best-sellers to move other inventory and attract new customers.\n\n**Action Plan:**\n- **Create a BOGO Offer:** For example, "Buy \'The Archived Snowboard\' and get a \'Bunny Bumm Snowboard Jockstrap\' for 50% off." This can increase the perceived value and drive conversions.\n\n### 5. **Engage Your Existing Customers**\n\nSince you have a solid base of customers who love your top products, focus on bringing them back.\n\n**Action Plan:**\n- **"We Miss You" Campaign:** Send an email with a special discount to customers who haven\'t purchased in a while.\n- **New Product Announcements:** Email your customer list whenever you launch new products to keep them engaged and interested in your brand.\n\nBy implementing these data-driven strategies, you can effectively boost your sales and foster greater customer loyalty.

                  'Of course! Here are 3 more data-driven tips to help you increase your sales:\n\n### 6. **Optimize Your Marketing for Peak Shopping Times**\n\nYour sales data shows that your customers are most active during specific hours of the day. By timing your marketing efforts to coincide with these peak times, you can capture customers when they are most likely to buy.\n\n- **Your Peak Sales Hours:**\n    - **4 AM:** ₩14,256,400 in sales\n    - **6 AM:** ₩12,469,300 in sales\n    - **8 AM:** ₩5,593,650 in sales\n\n**Action Plan:**\n- **Schedule Email & Social Media Campaigns:** Send out promotional emails and post on social media an hour or two before these peak times to ensure your brand is top-of-mind when customers are ready to shop.\n- **Run Flash Sales:** Launch limited-time offers that start at the beginning of these high-traffic periods to create a sense of urgency and drive immediate purchases. For example, a flash sale starting at 4 AM could capture that early-morning rush.\n\n### 7. **Create Targeted Product Bundles to Increase Order Value**\n\nWhile your best-sellers are driving a lot of sales, you can increase your revenue by encouraging customers to purchase more items in a single order.\n\n- **Your Top Sellers:**\n    1. The Archived Snowboard (112 units sold)\n    2. The Collection Snowboard: Oxygen (21 units sold)\n    3. The Collection Snowboard: Liquid (10 units sold)\n\n**Action Plan:**\n- **Bundle Best-Sellers with Complementary Items:** Create a "Complete Snowboarder Kit" by bundling "The Archived Snowboard" with a lower-selling but relevant item, like a snowboard bag or tuning kit. Offer this bundle at a slight discount compared to buying the items separately.\n- **"Tiered" Offers:** Encourage larger purchases with promotions like "Buy one snowboard, get 20% off any accessory" or "Spend ₩600,000 and get a free gift." This incentivizes customers to add more to their cart to unlock a reward.\n\n### 8. **Launch a "Refer-a-Friend" Program**\n\nSince you have a base of repeat customers (5 in the last 90 days), you can leverage their loyalty to acquire new customers at a lower cost than traditional advertising.\n\n**Action Plan:**\n- **Incentivize Both Parties:** Offer a discount or store credit to both the existing customer and the new customer they refer. For example, "Give your friends ₩20,000 off their first order, and you\'ll get ₩20,000 off your next purchase."\n- **Promote the Program:** Make the referral program highly visible on your website, in post-purchase emails, and on your social media channels. The easier it is for customers to find and use, the more successful it will be.\n\nBy implementing these strategies, you can further optimize your sales process, increase your average order value, and turn your existing customers into advocates for your brand.',

                  'Of course! Here are 5 tips to improve your sales, based on your business data:\n\n### 1. **Prominently Feature Your Best-Sellers**\n\nYour top-performing products are the most likely to sell, so make them impossible for shoppers to miss.\n\n- **Your Top 5 Best-Sellers (Last 30 Days):**\n    1. The Archived Snowboard\n    2. The Collection Snowboard: Oxygen\n    3. The Collection Snowboard: Liquid\n    4. Bunny Bumm Snowboard Jockstrap\n    5. The Hidden Snowboard\n\n**Action Plan:**\n- Place "The Archived Snowboard" and your other top sellers on your homepage.\n- Create a "Best-Sellers" collection and feature it in your main navigation menu.\n\n### 2. **Boost Your Average Order Value (AOV)**\n\nYour current AOV is **₩588,480**. Increasing this is a quick way to drive more revenue without needing more customers.\n\n**Action Plan:**\n- **Product Bundles:** Offer a discount for purchasing related items together. For example, bundle "The Archived Snowboard" with the "Bunny Bumm Snowboard Jockstrap."\n- **"Frequently Bought Together" Section:** Add a section on your product pages to suggest complementary items.\n- **Free Shipping Threshold:** Set a free shipping minimum that is slightly above your AOV to encourage customers to add more to their cart.\n\n### 3. **Launch a Customer Loyalty Program**\n\nYou have **5 repeat customers** from the last 90 days. A loyalty program can significantly increase this number.\n\n**Action Plan:**\n- **Points System:** Reward customers with points for every purchase, which they can redeem for discounts.\n- **Exclusive Perks:** Offer members-only benefits like early access to new products or exclusive sales.\n- **Email Marketing:** Announce your new loyalty program to all past customers to re-engage them.\n\n### 4. **Run a Targeted "Buy One, Get One" (BOGO) Promotion**\n\nLeverage your best-sellers to move other inventory and attract new customers.\n\n**Action Plan:**\n- **Create a BOGO Offer:** For example, "Buy \'The Archived Snowboard\' and get a \'Bunny Bumm Snowboard Jockstrap\' for 50% off." This can increase the perceived value and drive conversions.\n\n### 5. **Engage Your Existing Customers**\n\nSince you have a solid base of customers who love your top products, focus on bringing them back.\n\n**Action Plan:**\n- **"We Miss You" Campaign:** Send an email with a special discount to customers who haven\'t purchased in a while.\n- **New Product Announcements:** Email your customer list whenever you launch new products to keep them engaged and interested in your brand.\n\nBy implementing these data-driven strategies, you can effectively boost your sales and foster greater customer loyalty.

                  'Of course! Here are 3 more data-driven tips to help you increase your sales:\n\n### 6. **Optimize Your Marketing for Peak Shopping Times**\n\nYour sales data shows that your customers are most active during specific hours of the day. By timing your marketing efforts to coincide with these peak times, you can capture customers when they are most likely to buy.\n\n- **Your Peak Sales Hours:**\n    - **4 AM:** ₩14,256,400 in sales\n    - **6 AM:** ₩12,469,300 in sales\n    - **8 AM:** ₩5,593,650 in sales\n\n**Action Plan:**\n- **Schedule Email & Social Media Campaigns:** Send out promotional emails and post on social media an hour or two before these peak times to ensure your brand is top-of-mind when customers are ready to shop.\n- **Run Flash Sales:** Launch limited-time offers that start at the beginning of these high-traffic periods to create a sense of urgency and drive immediate purchases. For example, a flash sale starting at 4 AM could capture that early-morning rush.\n\n### 7. **Create Targeted Product Bundles to Increase Order Value**\n\nWhile your best-sellers are driving a lot of sales, you can increase your revenue by encouraging customers to purchase more items in a single order.\n\n- **Your Top Sellers:**\n    1. The Archived Snowboard (112 units sold)\n    2. The Collection Snowboard: Oxygen (21 units sold)\n    3. The Collection Snowboard: Liquid (10 units sold)\n\n**Action Plan:**\n- **Bundle Best-Sellers with Complementary Items:** Create a "Complete Snowboarder Kit" by bundling "The Archived Snowboard" with a lower-selling but relevant item, like a snowboard bag or tuning kit. Offer this bundle at a slight discount compared to buying the items separately.\n- **"Tiered" Offers:** Encourage larger purchases with promotions like "Buy one snowboard, get 20% off any accessory" or "Spend ₩600,000 and get a free gift." This incentivizes customers to add more to their cart to unlock a reward.\n\n### 8. **Launch a "Refer-a-Friend" Program**\n\nSince you have a base of repeat customers (5 in the last 90 days), you can leverage their loyalty to acquire new customers at a lower cost than traditional advertising.\n\n**Action Plan:**\n- **Incentivize Both Parties:** Offer a discount or store credit to both the existing customer and the new customer they refer. For example, "Give your friends ₩20,000 off their first order, and you\'ll get ₩20,000 off your next purchase."\n- **Promote the Program:** Make the referral program highly visible on your website, in post-purchase emails, and on your social media channels. The easier it is for customers to find and use, the more successful it will be.\n\nBy implementing these strategies, you can further optimize your sales process, increase your average order value, and turn your existing customers into advocates for your brand.',

        'Of course! Here are 5 tips to improve your sales, based on your business data:\n\n### 1. **Prominently Feature Your Best-Sellers**\n\nYour top-performing products are the most likely to sell, so make them impossible for shoppers to miss.\n\n- **Your Top 5 Best-Sellers (Last 30 Days):**\n    1. The Archived Snowboard\n    2. The Collection Snowboard: Oxygen\n    3. The Collection Snowboard: Liquid\n    4. Bunny Bumm Snowboard Jockstrap\n    5. The Hidden Snowboard\n\n**Action Plan:**\n- Place "The Archived Snowboard" and your other top sellers on your homepage.\n- Create a "Best-Sellers" collection and feature it in your main navigation menu.\n\n### 2. **Boost Your Average Order Value (AOV)**\n\nYour current AOV is **₩588,480**. Increasing this is a quick way to drive more revenue without needing more customers.\n\n**Action Plan:**\n- **Product Bundles:** Offer a discount for purchasing related items together. For example, bundle "The Archived Snowboard" with the "Bunny Bumm Snowboard Jockstrap."\n- **"Frequently Bought Together" Section:** Add a section on your product pages to suggest complementary items.\n- **Free Shipping Threshold:** Set a free shipping minimum that is slightly above your AOV to encourage customers to add more to their cart.\n\n### 3. **Launch a Customer Loyalty Program**\n\nYou have **5 repeat customers** from the last 90 days. A loyalty program can significantly increase this number.\n\n**Action Plan:**\n- **Points System:** Reward customers with points for every purchase, which they can redeem for discounts.\n- **Exclusive Perks:** Offer members-only benefits like early access to new products or exclusive sales.\n- **Email Marketing:** Announce your new loyalty program to all past customers to re-engage them.\n\n### 4. **Run a Targeted "Buy One, Get One" (BOGO) Promotion**\n\nLeverage your best-sellers to move other inventory and attract new customers.\n\n**Action Plan:**\n- **Create a BOGO Offer:** For example, "Buy \'The Archived Snowboard\' and get a \'Bunny Bumm Snowboard Jockstrap\' for 50% off." This can increase the perceived value and drive conversions.\n\n### 5. **Engage Your Existing Customers**\n\nSince you have a solid base of customers who love your top products, focus on bringing them back.\n\n**Action Plan:**\n- **"We Miss You" Campaign:** Send an email with a special discount to customers who haven\'t purchased in a while.\n- **New Product Announcements:** Email your customer list whenever you launch new products to keep them engaged and interested in your brand.\n\nBy implementing these data-driven strategies, you can effectively boost your sales and foster greater customer loyalty.

        'Of course! Here are 3 more data-driven tips to help you increase your sales:\n\n### 6. **Optimize Your Marketing for Peak Shopping Times**\n\nYour sales data shows that your customers are most active during specific hours of the day. By timing your marketing efforts to coincide with these peak times, you can capture customers when they are most likely to buy.\n\n- **Your Peak Sales Hours:**\n    - **4 AM:** ₩14,256,400 in sales\n    - **6 AM:** ₩12,469,300 in sales\n    - **8 AM:** ₩5,593,650 in sales\n\n**Action Plan:**\n- **Schedule Email & Social Media Campaigns:** Send out promotional emails and post on social media an hour or two before these peak times to ensure your brand is top-of-mind when customers are ready to shop.\n- **Run Flash Sales:** Launch limited-time offers that start at the beginning of these high-traffic periods to create a sense of urgency and drive immediate purchases. For example, a flash sale starting at 4 AM could capture that early-morning rush.\n\n### 7. **Create Targeted Product Bundles to Increase Order Value**\n\nWhile your best-sellers are driving a lot of sales, you can increase your revenue by encouraging customers to purchase more items in a single order.\n\n- **Your Top Sellers:**\n    1. The Archived Snowboard (112 units sold)\n    2. The Collection Snowboard: Oxygen (21 units sold)\n    3. The Collection Snowboard: Liquid (10 units sold)\n\n**Action Plan:**\n- **Bundle Best-Sellers with Complementary Items:** Create a "Complete Snowboarder Kit" by bundling "The Archived Snowboard" with a lower-selling but relevant item, like a snowboard bag or tuning kit. Offer this bundle at a slight discount compared to buying the items separately.\n- **"Tiered" Offers:** Encourage larger purchases with promotions like "Buy one snowboard, get 20% off any accessory" or "Spend ₩600,000 and get a free gift." This incentivizes customers to add more to their cart to unlock a reward.\n\n### 8. **Launch a "Refer-a-Friend" Program**\n\nSince you have a base of repeat customers (5 in the last 90 days), you can leverage their loyalty to acquire new customers at a lower cost than traditional advertising.\n\n**Action Plan:**\n- **Incentivize Both Parties:** Offer a discount or store credit to both the existing customer and the new customer they refer. For example, "Give your friends ₩20,000 off their first order, and you\'ll get ₩20,000 off your next purchase."\n- **Promote the Program:** Make the referral program highly visible on your website, in post-purchase emails, and on your social media channels. The easier it is for customers to find and use, the more successful it will be.\n\nBy implementing these strategies, you can further optimize your sales process, increase your average order value, and turn your existing customers into advocates for your brand.',
